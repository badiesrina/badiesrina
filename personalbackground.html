            <p>My name is Nurul Badrina Manja binti BadrulHisham and I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you .I am 19 years old . I was born and raised in Malacca, a place that holds a special corner in my heart for its rich cultural heritage and warm community. 
I grew up in a simple yet loving family where we always supported and encouraged one another. Whenever a family member felt disappointed or sad, we served as their backbone, helping them to recover from their sadness.
These experiences have taught me values such as resilience, kindness and determination , which I try to uphold in my daily life .</p>

            <p> I would describe myself as being very introverted and quiet. I’m also very independent. I really don’t like working with partners, unless they’re my friends or I feel comfortable around them. But I generally like to do things on my own.</p>

         <p>Among my interests is that I like to read Fixi Novels, more specifically the works of "Ismi Fa Ismail". This is because Fixi novels have many lessons that we can use as examples in life .
 For example, when we make a decision, don't do it in a state of anger or haste because in that state our brain cannot function properly. So, the decision made may cause us to regret later.
Other than that , I also love to drawing.  I always enjoyed drawing when I have free time. I started drawing at a young age. The first time I 've decided to draw, I couldn’t resist from not owning a few pencils and notebooks.  I was so intrigued from the connection and satisfaction I felt when I first ran the pencil in that notebook, I believe it will always be a part of me.
My parents and the internet taught me how to draw difficult pictures. They always said "The ability to draw is mainly like expressing how you feel at the moment".Drawing was a skill that I developed after practicing every day.  I cleared my mind from all the daily distraction and it helped me focus on the task.
